# Customer Lifetime Value & Loyalty in Retail Banking
### Overview

This repository includes the data, code and supporting material for an MSc Business Analytics dissertation analysis of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and customer loyalty (churn) in the retail banking sector using statistical and machine learning techniques.

### Data Source

The analysis is based on an anonymised synthetic retail banking data set consisting of 5000 customer records.
The dataset is composed of demographic, behavioural, and financial variables of the customer such as transaction activity, account balance, credit usage, loans, and customer tenure.
Source: Synthetic banking dataset, which is available on a public basis

Format: publicly available repository in CSV format

Privcy and Usage: the data set is completely anonymised to address ethical concerns about personal data to make it appropriate for academic predictive analytics

### Repository Structure
ComprehensiveBankingDatabase.csv - dataset of 5000 anonymised synthetic retail banking records.

Contents - Includes demographic, behavioural and financial features e.g. transaction activity, tenure, credit usage used for model training.

DISSERTATION PROJECT CODING.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook that includes the following:

Data Engineering: Cleaning, Imputation & Feature Scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical visualisation of drivers of churn & distribution checks.

Feature Engineering: Building of CLV proxy and behavioural metrics.
